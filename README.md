Objective of this study is to understand the article 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/generate-bitonic-sequence-of-length-n-from-integers-in-a-given-range/

Then, install haskell on my machine

Understand both solutions

Try to apply on haskell, I believe that haskell can have methods that will accelerate or turn the solution simpler, so I should do a research around it

ok, so first probably, I need to choose one path, re-do the alogorithm using haskell or re-do already triyng to implement something that could help the solution

At the end, I must do some unit tests, for it I'll need to understand how unit tests works on haskell
